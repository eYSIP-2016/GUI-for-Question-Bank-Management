\chapter[Project Tag]{Question Bank Management}
\section*{Abstract}

\hspace{0.6cm} The aim of this project is to organize and ease the process of question bank management through a web-based application. Question Bank Management can mainly be bifurcated into two important tasks viz. Question Creation and Question Reviewal.  \\

The application simplifies the task of adding elements like diagram, equations and code to questions by providing interfaces for the same. For better discretion of solving the questions, elements like difficulty level, Category, tags and expected solving time can also be added to question.	\\

The applicaton shall automate the task of evenly distributing the questions amongst the users.	Revision history to keep track of all changes made to a question and control the versions of a question, is also maintained by this application.	\\

The ultimate goal of this application is to reduce the fuss created in a closed group during the conventional question bank management process and give the process a drive(which the conventional process may lack) that is required for efficient and harmonious performance of the outfit. \\

\subsection{Features}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item User Authentication and Registration
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The application supports 2 types of users :
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Administrator 
                    \item Normal User
                \end{enumerate}
                
            \item Normal users may further have two roles creator(user who creates the question) and reviewer(who reviews questions allotted to him).
            
            \item The Application houses and serves a closed group of users, due to which common users are unable to register onto the application. 
            
            \item Thus the Admin has the authority to add new users to the application 
            
            \item A user wont be able to access any of the utilities of the application unless she/he has been authenticated or unless she/he has a user account registered for him 
            
            \item Password reset procedure has been created for normal users, where a email containing a password reset link is sent to the users on his email-ID 
            
            \item The admin can also delete users if need be from the application.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Question Creation 
            \begin{itemize}
            
            \item Question description and Coding box : 
            
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Question description being typed by the user is transformed into image in real-time and previewed below accordingly.
                
                \item The description being typed is entered on an HTML hidden canvas which is then used to generate an image, whose URL is updated in the image present on every \textit{'onkeyup'} event
                
                \item The same coding logic applies for the code to image conversion, only wth variation in colors and text font used to give llokk and feel consistent with the field of coding
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item Equation Box : 
            
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The \LaTeX code for equation typed in this window is used to obtain the image URL generated of the equation photo generated by the open API of code-cogs. \href{https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php}{CodeCogs equation editor}
                    
                    \item The URL of the image generated is dependent on the equation typed.
                    
                    \item The URL shall have a fixed part and an variable part which varies with every equation
                    
                    \item This is the permanent part :
                        \begin{minted}{html}
    https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?
                        \end{minted}
                        
                    \item As said earlier the variable part is dependent on equation being typed  which is obtained in the following manner:
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item if the number of adjoining spaces is more than one then they are replaced with just one single space  using the following regular expression :
                                \begin{minted}{html}
    "\s+"
                                \end{minted}
                            
                            \item then variable part is URI encoded and then concatenated to the fixed part which generates the entire link, which can now be updated in the \textit{src} of the image preview tag and the value of the hidden form field
                            
                            
                        \end{enumerate}

            \end{itemize}
            
            
        \item Picking a Question 
            \begin{itemize}
              \item While browsing the question bank the users may want to compose a new question by making minor changes to an existing question
              
              \item The users shall be redirected to page with the form similar to that of the Compose interface, with fields set to the value of the initial question.
              
              \item on submit the post request is sent to the Controller closure of the Create a question feature and a new question is composed with the creator set to the user who picked the question
            \end{itemize}
            
        \item Editing a Question 
            \begin{itemize}

              \item After making the changes, the post request for that page shall be sent to controller closure where the received values from that form are compared with the existing values, if the values are the same, no updates are made.
            \end{itemize}
            
        \item Navigating the Question Bank 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Currently searching the questions is based on tags and string search on the question description. Search box for entering the string and a multiple select box for the selecting the tags is provided. This feature has been implemented in the \textit{Home} and \textit{Browse} interface
                
                \item \textit{Home}

            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item Review
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Criteria : For Distribution of questions to reviewers
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Each questions should have only 2 reviewers.
                    \item  The Creator of the questions should not get his/her own created questions for reviewing.
                    \item  The Distribution of questions should be on fairness and efficiency basis.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Process : Alloting questions to review
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item  The process runs a special algorithm to submit questions for review 
                    \item  The algorithm distributes questions to the different users efficiently and in such a way that the user is paired with all the other users
                    \item  From the set of all possible pairs, random pairs is given a question to review individually
                    \item The pair should not be repeated until all the combinations of pairs of different users are alloted a question
                    \item Once the question is alloted, the flag of allotment is set which indicates the status whether 'alloted' or not
                    \item After the question is reviewed,the flag for allotment is set which indicates whether reviewed or not.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Algorithm :
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The List of users who created question are fetched from the database 
                    \item for each user all the questions are fetched which are to be reviewed
                    \item The matrix is formed corresponding to the self-cartesian product of users who haven't created any question
                    \item  step 1 foreach question, a pair((\(row_{m} , column_n{n}\)) refers to the index of users) in the upper triangular part of the matrix is alloted a question
                    \item  step 2 if the pair in the upper triangular matrix is finished then shuffle the sequence of users and reform a matrix corresponding to the self-cartesian product and repeat step 2
                    \item  step 3 if no of questions gets exhausted then break the current iteration and go to the outer loop
                    \item iterate or end inner loop
                    \item iterate or end outer loop
                \end{itemize}
            \item Review :
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Given to the users, the question  to be reviewed, the user might want to modify or might not want to modify
                    \item If modified then there is a history on the update of the question and questions get removed from the reviewers list
                    \item  If not modified then the reviewers submits no changes and the question gets removed
                \end{itemize}

            \end{enumerate}

        \vspace{1in}
        \item Review interface
            \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given to the users, the question  to be reviewed, the user might want to modify or might not want to modify
            \item It contains the following button
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item  No Change : Whenever the reviewers does not want to modify considering it as appropriate
                                \item  Modify : Whenever the reviewers wants to modify the edit on question method is called in the new browser 
                            \end{itemize}
           
            \item If modified then there is a history on the update of the questions and questions get removed from the reviewers list
            \item  If not modified then the reviewers submits no changes and the questions get removed
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \item History interface
            \begin{enumerate}
            \item This Section shows the latest version of all questions and the no of version a question has in the history
            \item Every question has a button indicating the version no, provided that the question has the version history
            \item After clicking on the version no button the user is redirected to a new page where there will be display of latest version and \(n^{th}\) version of the question
            \item It contains the following button
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Cancel : Redirects the users to the previous page
                                \item Restore : Restores the current version to the  version
                            \end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interesting insights can be gained by performing mining operations on the data generated in the system
        
        \item As every application has scope for improvement, studies can be done to develop various algorithms for distribution of questions in more selective manner and organized (as per categories or sub-categories, or difficulty level)
        
        \item The application has a coding window. APIs that give results of the code being typed and allow features such as auto-indentation can also be integrated into the existing system
        
        \item An algorithm for automating the process of creating question sets using the existing question bank can be created, each of which is of the simillar difficulty level.
    \end{itemize}
